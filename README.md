### This repository contains my solution to [Challenge 4](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/challenge-4-soccer-scripting) in the [Unity Junior Programmer Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer).


### Challenge:
- When you hit an enemy, it should send it away from the player.
- A new wave should spawn when all enemy balls have been removed.
- The powerup should only last for a certain duration, then disappear.
- One more enemy should be spawned for every new wave.
- The enemy balls should go towards the “Player Goal” object.
- The player should get a speed boost whenever the player presses spacebar - and a particle effect should appear when they use it.
- The enemies’ speed should increase in speed by a small amount with every new wave.
